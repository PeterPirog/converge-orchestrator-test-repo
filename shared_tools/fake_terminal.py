"""Fake terminal for simulating command execution in acceptance tests.

REQ-0C50BE10F3 (ACCEPT-001 — Structured command simulation): the structured
command-simulation contract is an exact mirror of this module's plain-text
simulator. Any structured representation of a simulated command execution
must carry a stdout field that is a byte-for-byte mirror of the string
returned by ``run_command(command: str) -> str`` for the same command —
identical bytes, order, and length, with no reformatting, normalization,
truncation, or added context. ``run_command`` never delegates to any other
operating-system command execution API; it only returns deterministic
simulated text, and that exact text is what structured simulations must
reproduce.
